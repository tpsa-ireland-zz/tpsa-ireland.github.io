## Who are we?

We are a student organisation founded in 2019 aiming solely at enhancing student performance along academic, industry, and communicative axes simultaneously. 

## What are we doing?

Current we are working on a number of projects, including:

Student-delivered teaching seminars, 3 times a week, 2-3 hours a night. Students can ask older students for help on hard topics. Students are encouraged to present their intuition to their fellow classmates, practicing their articulation of high-level technical information. This is also an opportunity for the teachers to embellish their CV's with teaching experience.

Academic and career oriented interviews: We have interviewed graduates of Theoretical Physics in various different fields, including a string theorist, a laser experimentalist, a data scientist, an astrophysicist, and a member of a consultancy start-up. These interviews were attended live over zoom by anywhere between 30 and 50 members. We've also hosted a LinkedIn Workshop delivered by a LinkedIn employee, and an internships night, where successful applicants to internships have went through the application processes and their experiences. 

*We have begun* training so that TCD may compete at the [International Theoretical Physics Olympiad](http://thworldcup.com/about2022). This will put Theoretical Physics at TCD at the same level as MIT, Harvard, Moscow for the world to see.

*We have begun* to put together a TPSA online library wherein students record pedagogical walkthroughs of key textbooks in the field in TCD's Schrodinger lecture theatre. This is an opportunity for students to concretely put their name to published material, and well as enhance support for students regarding difficult concepts. We believe in not gate-keeping intuition and understanding, and so these lectures will be publicly available on Youtube. We have 60+ hours recorded, currently in the editing phase. 

*We hope to* leverage student internship experience to deliver workshops in TCD next summer on machine learning and quantum information, subjects currently outside of physics curricula that is extremely relevant in the modern research landscape.

## How can I get involved?

If you are a student in TCD you can attend one of our weekly seminars (the times are announced in advance on Instagram) or sign up for our mailing list. If you aren't a student in TCD send us an email at [tpsa.ire@gmail.com](mailto:tpsa.ire@gmail.com).
